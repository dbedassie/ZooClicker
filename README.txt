Pitch / Game Idea
        The planet has taken a beating these past thousands of years and lives on this planet are reaping the horrible effects of such. It is our job to repair Mother Earth and help each other as Her children. In Zoo Clicker, you will manage your own very Zoo, this entails managing habitats, limiting pollution on your property, educating guests, and most importantly protecting and re-establishing wildlife animals into the world.
Basic Gameplay


* Clicker mechanic
   * This is the main mechanic for the game.
      * There will be images of various animals in your Zoo. If you click on these animals, you will receive donations.
* Donations and Upgrades
   * The more you click the more donations ($$$) you obtain. With your donation money, you can upgrade your habitats to increase their appeal and receive better donations.
   * These upgrades will increase by small amounts  per habitat level, and exponentially increase every 25 levels as well.
* STRETCH: If upgraded enough, habitats can gain donations without your clicking.
   * At level 50 of a habitat, the player will obtain a %  of clicking benefits every X amount of seconds for that specific habitat.
